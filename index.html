                <h3> Who am I? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Matthew
                    Shore. I am currently in my
                    third and final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Portsmouth. The reason that
                    I decided to study Computer Science is because I have always enjoyed working with computers and
                    using computers
                    to solve problems.
                </p>

                <h3> What are my goals? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    My goal is to pursue a career in Web Development once I graduate. I have mostly
                    been focused on front-end develoment so far
                    however, I do have back-end experience and it is something that I am looking to build upon both at
                    home and professionally.
                </p>

                <h3> What is my relevant experience? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Work experience: I worked for 13 months as a front-end web devloper at Fresh Relevance which is a
                    company based in Southampton.
                    This was done as my placement year for my degree. My main responsibilities involved writing scripts
                    using Javascript which could be put on
                    to client's websites to track the browsing habits of users.
                </p>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Independent Projects: In my spare time I undertake many independent projects.
                    This website is a great
                    example of the independent projects that I undertake. The purpose of all my projects is to develop
                    my
                    skills in that particular area. See the projects page on this site for more information on what I
                    do.

                <p class='articleText'>
                    IBM Subversive Project: From September 2017 till July 2018 I took part in the IBM
                    Subversive Project.
                    This project was about cyber security vulnerabilities and how we can demonstate these
                    vulnerabilities to
                    people with limited technical knowledge of cyber security. For this project as a team of 3, we had
                    to
                    plan, design, create and present a model of an airport and demonstrate the cyber security risks
                    found at
                    an airport. We demonstated our project using Raspberry-pi and LED lighting to IBM cyber security
                    professionals in July. This project was great to undertake, the skills I gained from this project,
                    such
                    as designing/implementing a solution and team work are very valuable and are skills I continue to
                    develop today.

                    University coursework’s
                    have been in these languages. I am reasonably competent at them. I work on developing my skills in
                    these
                    programming languages each week.

                <h2>Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure on the Web.</h2>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Information exposure</b> is a serious issue facing all corporations in the
                    twenty first century.
                    Preventing information exposure is essential for maintaining the security of the information itself
                    and those whom are associated with the information. Hence Corporations take great steps to mitigate
                    corporate information exposure on the web. This review covers the various methods which corporations
                    can employ to reduce their information exposure on the web.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Firewalls</b> are an essential part of how corporations mitigate information
                    exposure on the web.
                    The
                    primary purpose of a firewall is to prevent access from one network to another. Therefore companies
                    are able to use firewalls to prevent unwanted pieces of data from gaining entry to their network and
                    also to prevent unwanted pieces of data from leaving their network to the wider web. Firewalls in
                    corporations are typically part of the information access policy that the corporation has in place.
                    Firewalls are also managed by network engineers and the network administrator.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Firewall configurations in corporations also have to be regularly reviewed and
                    independently audited
                    to ensure that there are no unnecessary configurations on the firewall which might compromise the
                    security of the network.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>VPNs (virtual private networks)</b> are another method which corporations use
                    to mitigate their
                    information exposure on the web. VPNs are very similar to firewalls in how they operate. Both a
                    firewall and a VPN aim to protect your data and information when you are online. A VPN operates by
                    tapping into a variety of dedicated connections using encryption protocols to create a virtual peer
                    to peer connection. If someone who does not have the required permissions tries to access the
                    transmitted data they will not be able to do anything with it because the data is encrypted.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>The use of VPNs in corporations is on the rise as of 2017. The main reason for
                    this is that a VPN is
                    able to greatly reduce the risk of security breaches to the corporation and at the same time a VPN
                    is very cost effective to use over other methods such as installing a corporate wide firewall. </p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Proxy servers</b> are another method which corporations use to mitigate their
                    information exposure
                    on the
                    web. A proxy server essentially acts as the intermediary between the device trying to access the
                    network and the network itself. This can significantly improve the security of a corporation’s
                    network from potential information exposure by keeping the internal network structure that the
                    corporation uses secret from the device accessing that it is communicating with by using network
                    address translation. This makes the requests anonymous. Use of proxy servers are often used side by
                    side with firewalls</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Another key aspect that corporations use to help mitigate against information
                    exposure on the web is
                    to train their employees who work within their company and network on Cyber Security. Corporations
                    such as Google and Facebook regularly educate and train their staff on the potential risks that are
                    involved when working on their network. This reduces the chance of an accidental leak of information
                    from their network onto the web from someone inside of the corporation.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>In addition to this corporations can also limit the amount of data which their
                    employees have to a
                    need to know basis. This can be done via permissions and user settings – limiting the amount of data
                    and information that a particular account will have access to. Limiting the amount of people who
                    have access to particular pieces of information reduces the chance of one of the people who has
                    access accidentally or intentionally leaking the information out to the wider web. Hence mitigating
                    the risk of exposure.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>In conclusion</b> corporations employ a wide range of methods to mitigate
                    their information exposure to
                    the web. These include the implementation and use of Firewalls, Proxy Servers, Virtual Private
                    Networks and training and informing their staff about the issues regarding cyber security. </p>
