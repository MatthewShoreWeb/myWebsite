                <p class='articleText'>
                    Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Matthew
                    Shore. I am currently in my
                    third and final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Portsmouth. The reason that
                    I decided to study Computer Science is because I have always enjoyed working with computers and
                    using computers
                    to solve problems.
                </p>

                <h3> What are my goals? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    My goal is to pursue a career in Web Development once I graduate. I have mostly
                    been focused on front-end develoment so far
                    however, I do have back-end experience and it is something that I am looking to build upon both at
                    home and professionally.
                </p>

                <h3> What is my relevant experience? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Work experience: I worked for 13 months as a front-end web devloper at Fresh Relevance which is a
                    company based in Southampton.
                    This was done as my placement year for my degree. My main responsibilities involved writing scripts
                    using Javascript which could be put on
                    to client's websites to track the browsing habits of users.

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Independent Projects: In my spare time I undertake many independent projects.
                    This website is a great
                    example of the independent projects that I undertake. The purpose of all my projects is to develop
                    my
                    skills in that particular area. See the projects page on this site for more information on what I
                    do.

                    IBM Subversive Project: From September 2017 till July 2018 I took part in the IBM
                    Subversive Project.
                    This project was about cyber security vulnerabilities and how we can demonstate these
                    vulnerabilities to
                    people with limited technical knowledge of cyber security. For this project as a team of 3, we had
                    to
                    plan, design, create and present a model of an airport and demonstrate the cyber security risks
                    found at
                    an airport. We demonstated our project using Raspberry-pi and LED lighting to IBM cyber security
                    professionals in July. This project was great to undertake, the skills I gained from this project,
                    such
                    as designing/implementing a solution and team work are very valuable and are skills I continue to
                    develop today.

                <h2>Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure on the Web.</h2>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Information exposure</b> is a serious issue facing all corporations in the
                    twenty first century.
                    Preventing information exposure is essential for maintaining the security of the information itself
                    and those whom are associated with the information. Hence Corporations take great steps to mitigate
                    corporate information exposure on the web. This review covers the various methods which corporations
                    can employ to reduce their information exposure on the web.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Firewalls</b> are an essential part of how corporations mitigate information
                    exposure on the web.
                    The
                    primary purpose of a firewall is to prevent access from one network to another. Therefore companies
                    are able to use firewalls to prevent unwanted pieces of data from gaining entry to their network and
                    also to prevent unwanted pieces of data from leaving their network to the wider web. Firewalls in
                    corporations are typically part of the information access policy that the corporation has in place.
                    Firewalls are also managed by network engineers and the network administrator.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Firewall configurations in corporations also have to be regularly reviewed and
                    independently audited
                    to ensure that there are no unnecessary configurations on the firewall which might compromise the
                    security of the network.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>VPNs (virtual private networks)</b> are another method which corporations use
                    to mitigate their
                    information exposure on the web. VPNs are very similar to firewalls in how they operate. Both a
                    firewall and a VPN aim to protect your data and information when you are online. A VPN operates by
                    tapping into a variety of dedicated connections using encryption protocols to create a virtual peer
                    to peer connection. If someone who does not have the required permissions tries to access the
                    transmitted data they will not be able to do anything with it because the data is encrypted.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>The use of VPNs in corporations is on the rise as of 2017. The main reason for
                    this is that a VPN is
                    able to greatly reduce the risk of security breaches to the corporation and at the same time a VPN
                    is very cost effective to use over other methods such as installing a corporate wide firewall. </p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Proxy servers</b> are another method which corporations use to mitigate their
                    information exposure
                    on the
                    web. A proxy server essentially acts as the intermediary between the device trying to access the
                    network and the network itself. This can significantly improve the security of a corporation’s
                    network from potential information exposure by keeping the internal network structure that the
                    corporation uses secret from the device accessing that it is communicating with by using network
                    address translation. This makes the requests anonymous. Use of proxy servers are often used side by
                    side with firewalls</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Another key aspect that corporations use to help mitigate against information
                    exposure on the web is
                    to train their employees who work within their company and network on Cyber Security. Corporations
                    such as Google and Facebook regularly educate and train their staff on the potential risks that are
                    involved when working on their network. This reduces the chance of an accidental leak of information
                    from their network onto the web from someone inside of the corporation.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>In addition to this corporations can also limit the amount of data which their
                    employees have to a
                    need to know basis. This can be done via permissions and user settings – limiting the amount of data
                    and information that a particular account will have access to. Limiting the amount of people who
                    have access to particular pieces of information reduces the chance of one of the people who has
                    access accidentally or intentionally leaking the information out to the wider web. Hence mitigating
                    the risk of exposure.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>In conclusion</b> corporations employ a wide range of methods to mitigate
                    their information exposure to
                    the web. These include the implementation and use of Firewalls, Proxy Servers, Virtual Private
                    Networks and training and informing their staff about the issues regarding cyber security. </p>

                <h2> Security in Video Surveillance Systems </h2>

                <p class='articleText'><b>Abstract</b> - This paper will detail the security in modern commercial video
                    surveillance systems; in
                    particular to vulnerabilities onset from less than ideal generic firmware. With the increasing use
                    of smart video surveillance systems in homes and small businesses, the robustness of said systems
                    has as of late come under scrutiny. Many of the issues found to pertain to poor firmware. Therefore,
                    the goal of this paper is to critically evaluate methods in which to protect modern video
                    surveillance systems and propose new methods and/or practices that will further increase the
                    security of both existing and new systems. Such methods include the implementation of network
                    intrusion detection systems (NIDS), robust operating protocols and manufacturer firmware support. A
                    method proposed in this paper is a method of our design and outlines a risk assessment framework

                <h3> 1.0 Introduction </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>A significant increase in internet usage and advancements in networking
                    technology over the last
                    decade has resulted in the increased affordability, accessibility and reliability of video security
                    systems. Many homeowners and small businesses now rely on such systems to secure properties and
                    monitor sensitive business areas.

                    Our research problem is to find common vulnerabilities in consumer-grade video security systems and
                    propose solutions to mitigate them.

                    Systems of this nature will only become more vulnerable as internet technologies develop. For
                    instance, 5G enabled networks are becoming ever more prevalent since their adoption privately as
                    well as their adoption publicly through government initiatives. Qian Clara Li et al. suggests a
                    global increase in mobile network traffic by a factor of 1000 over the next decade implying that the
                    world would be more connected but all the while, increasing the likelihood of cyberattacks [1].

                    In this paper, we conduct a literature review on the types of common vulnerabilities and their
                    corresponding exploits against these devices and evaluate possible countermeasures, and then we
                    finally propose an enhanced solution by using a risk assessment that suits our problem best,
                    providing results where applicable.
                </p>

                <h4> 2.1 Background </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A video surveillance system in and of itself is a tool used to improve the
                    security of certain aspects of an institution, in particular to the physical security of assets,
                    persons and dependent systems. However, preventing network-related cyber attacks in video
                    surveillance systems is paramount because these systems inherently pertain to informational, cyber
                    and physical security hazards and pose a significant risk if proper control measures are not
                    implemented during a system’s development life cycle. </p>
                <h4> 2.2 Current Vulnerabilities </h4>
                <h3> 3.0 Proposed Risk Assessment </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>In this section, we will present a risk assessment based on the previously
                    identified vulnerabilities and solutions. We will quantify each vulnerability on how likely it is to
                    be exploited and the potential risk to the network if it is exploited. We will be using a scale of 1
                    to 10, with 1 being low risk and 10 being the highest risk.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Please see the risk assessment table in the appendix.</p>
                <h3>4.0 Evaluation of Solution</h3>
                <p class='articleText'>Our methodology for evaluating our proposed solutions is to reference experiments
                    from other sources and then evaluate them based on how well they solve the solution and how much we
                    can learn from them. The reason behind this approach is due to the nature of some of these
                    vulnerabilities we do not have the resources to set up a full experiment ourselves and collect data.
                    For example, a supply chain attack.</p>
                <h4>4.1 Man in the middle </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study by Michael R. Lyu and Lorrien K. Y. Lau focuses on evaluating the
                    effectiveness of Firewalls in networks. The study evaluates the performance and security of
                    different types of firewalls. The study focuses on the fact that it is necessary to achieve a
                    balance between security and performance when choosing a firewall. </p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Figure 1</b> from the study assesses firewalls with security policies of 1 to
                    7 with higher being more secure. Their study shows the effectiveness of firewalls in preventing MitM
                    attacks and other vulnerabilities.</p>
                <img />
                <img />
                <p class='articleText'>It is also proven that generally, as the protection increases, performance
                    decreases. See <b>Figure 2</b> which shows the direct transaction time increase with each security
                    policy
                    level. [18]</p>

                <h4> 4.2 Insecure Software </h4>
                <img />
                <p class='articleText'>Furthermore, studies conducted by Frederick T. Sheldon et al showcased the impact
                    of insecure software being used in wireless networks. The study investigates ways in which network
                    security can be improved and how
                    attacks can be mitigated. It is shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, which assesses different firmware versions
                    against an attack, that firmware is crucial for network security. <b>Figure 3</b> shows that up to
                    date
                    firmware can be the difference between a successful attack or a failed one. The study concludes that
                    having the most up to date firmware possible is the best approach to mitigate vulnerabilities. [19]
                </p>
                <h4> 4.3 Supply Chain </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study by Chad W Autry and L. Michelle Bobbit proposes a framework for supply
                    chain security. In
                    their study, they collected data from 31 supply chains to assess the security vulnerabilities of
                    them and suggest improvements. In their proposed framework they suggest a series of technological
                    improvements to increase the security of the supply chain. For example, based on data collected from
                    supply managers, it suggests that electronically scanning shipments and using real-time technology
                    to mitigate tampering. [17] </p>
                <h4> 4.4 Protocol based </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study conducted by Cristian L. Leca in Romania conducted an assessment of over
                    100,000 networks
                    assessing their security protocols.
                    The study showed that over 4 years, the city of Bucharest had an increase in more modern security
                    certifications, up to 86% using WPA2 which is in line with the world standard. The results of the
                    study showed that attacks on wireless networks decreased over the 4 years as a direct result of the
                    adoption of more up to date protocols. [14]
                </p>

                <h3> 5.0 Conclusion </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>In conclusion, with the world being ever more interconnected the importance of
                    good security measures
                    in video surveillance systems is as high as ever. With issues that can be present anywhere from
                    default software and hardware to issues based on outdated protocols, it is highly recommended that
                    users, as well as manufacturers, should enact the solutions outlined in our risk assessment to
                    mitigate the corresponding risks. Though due to limitations in hardware availability and our ability
                    to meet in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic we had to rely on previous data and results of
                    other researchers which have been proven effective in their techniques for shoring up defences of
                    the user in the fight against malicious attacks. However, with technology rapidly evolving new risks
                    will always develop and users must keep themselves informed of new threats and ways to mitigate them
                    to ensure network security in the future. Additionally, the vulnerabilities mentioned here is not a
                    complete list of all potential threats, just the ones viewed as most significant.
