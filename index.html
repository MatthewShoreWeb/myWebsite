                <h3> Summary </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    I am a computer science student with a year of experience based in Portsmouth who is currently on
                    track to receive a first-class honours degree upon graduation. I am seeking a graduate-level
                    software developer role focused on web technologies to start once I graduate. This is an area that I
                    find interesting have previous experience in, and I am eager to build upon that experience and
                    potentially branch into areas that I have not got much experience in.
                </p>

                <h3> Experience </h3>


                <p class='cvParagraph'>I spent slightly over a year on industrial placement working as a software developer at Fresh
                    Relevance. The focus of the role involved writing JavaScript scripts that would then be used on
                    client’s ecommerce websites. The role also gave me the opportunity to work on other areas such
                    as creating UI components in React which would be linked to an API that I wrote in Python. The
                    placement greatly improved my technical skills and knowledge as well as developed soft skills
                    such as communication and time management as I would frequently be communicating with the
                    support team and other developers to ensure the scripts met the customers requirements.</p>
                <p class='cvParagraph'>For my dissertation project I created a fully functional React Native mobile app for a client.
                    This involved working closely with a client as well as with my academic supervisor. I learnt a
                    lot about React Native and mobile app development as well as the software development process
                    from requirements elicitations to design and implementation with a client.</p>
                <p class='cvParagraph'>During my first year of university, I was involved in the IBM subversive project. This team
                    project involved researching, designing, and then building a cyber security solution and then
                    presenting it a group at IBM. My team chose to focus on cyber security issues relating to an
                    airport. My role was focused on research and construction of the solution.</p>
                <p class='cvParagraph'>Personal project that I have done include, scalable and responsive websites (this), web-based games, a
                    python game hex-grid generator and creating an IoT plant sensor device.</p>

                <h2>Mitigating Corporate Information Exposure on the Web.</h2>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Information exposure</b> is a serious issue facing all corporations in the
                    twenty first century.
                    Preventing information exposure is essential for maintaining the security of the information itself
                    and those whom are associated with the information. Hence Corporations take great steps to mitigate
                    corporate information exposure on the web. This review covers the various methods which corporations
                    can employ to reduce their information exposure on the web.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Firewalls</b> are an essential part of how corporations mitigate information
                    exposure on the web.
                    The
                    primary purpose of a firewall is to prevent access from one network to another. Therefore companies
                    are able to use firewalls to prevent unwanted pieces of data from gaining entry to their network and
                    also to prevent unwanted pieces of data from leaving their network to the wider web. Firewalls in
                    corporations are typically part of the information access policy that the corporation has in place.
                    Firewalls are also managed by network engineers and the network administrator.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Firewall configurations in corporations also have to be regularly reviewed and
                    independently audited
                    to ensure that there are no unnecessary configurations on the firewall which might compromise the
                    security of the network.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>VPNs (virtual private networks)</b> are another method which corporations use
                    to mitigate their
                    information exposure on the web. VPNs are very similar to firewalls in how they operate. Both a
                    firewall and a VPN aim to protect your data and information when you are online. A VPN operates by
                    tapping into a variety of dedicated connections using encryption protocols to create a virtual peer
                    to peer connection. If someone who does not have the required permissions tries to access the
                    transmitted data they will not be able to do anything with it because the data is encrypted.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>The use of VPNs in corporations is on the rise as of 2017. The main reason for
                    this is that a VPN is
                    able to greatly reduce the risk of security breaches to the corporation and at the same time a VPN
                    is very cost effective to use over other methods such as installing a corporate wide firewall. </p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Proxy servers</b> are another method which corporations use to mitigate their
                    information exposure
                    on the
                    web. A proxy server essentially acts as the intermediary between the device trying to access the
                    network and the network itself. This can significantly improve the security of a corporation’s
                    network from potential information exposure by keeping the internal network structure that the
                    corporation uses secret from the device accessing that it is communicating with by using network
                    address translation. This makes the requests anonymous. Use of proxy servers are often used side by
                    side with firewalls</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Another key aspect that corporations use to help mitigate against information
                    exposure on the web is
                    to train their employees who work within their company and network on Cyber Security. Corporations
                    such as Google and Facebook regularly educate and train their staff on the potential risks that are
                    involved when working on their network. This reduces the chance of an accidental leak of information
                    from their network onto the web from someone inside of the corporation.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>In addition to this corporations can also limit the amount of data which their
                    employees have to a
                    need to know basis. This can be done via permissions and user settings – limiting the amount of data
                    and information that a particular account will have access to. Limiting the amount of people who
                    have access to particular pieces of information reduces the chance of one of the people who has
                    access accidentally or intentionally leaking the information out to the wider web. Hence mitigating
                    the risk of exposure.</p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>In conclusion</b> corporations employ a wide range of methods to mitigate
                    their information exposure to
                    the web. These include the implementation and use of Firewalls, Proxy Servers, Virtual Private
                    Networks and training and informing their staff about the issues regarding cyber security. </p>

                <p class='articleText'><b>Disclaimer: This paper was done as part of a team. However I did make

                <p class='articleText'><b>Abstract</b> - This paper will detail the security in modern commercial video
                    surveillance systems; in
                    particular to vulnerabilities onset from less than ideal generic firmware. With the increasing use
                    of smart video surveillance systems in homes and small businesses, the robustness of said systems
                    has as of late come under scrutiny. Many of the issues found to pertain to poor firmware. Therefore,
                    the goal of this paper is to critically evaluate methods in which to protect modern video
                    surveillance systems and propose new methods and/or practices that will further increase the
                    security of both existing and new systems. Such methods include the implementation of network
                    intrusion detection systems (NIDS), robust operating protocols and manufacturer firmware support. A
                    method proposed in this paper is a method of our design and outlines a risk assessment framework
                    enabling manufacturers to continually assess the security of their systems while also presenting
                    potential solutions to vulnerabilities that pose the most risk to the overall system security. </p>

                <h3> 1.0 Introduction </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>A significant increase in internet usage and advancements in networking
                    technology over the last
                    decade has resulted in the increased affordability, accessibility and reliability of video security
                    systems. Many homeowners and small businesses now rely on such systems to secure properties and
                    monitor sensitive business areas.

                    Our research problem is to find common vulnerabilities in consumer-grade video security systems and
                    propose solutions to mitigate them.

                    Systems of this nature will only become more vulnerable as internet technologies develop. For
                    instance, 5G enabled networks are becoming ever more prevalent since their adoption privately as
                    well as their adoption publicly through government initiatives. Qian Clara Li et al. suggests a
                    global increase in mobile network traffic by a factor of 1000 over the next decade implying that the
                    world would be more connected but all the while, increasing the likelihood of cyberattacks [1].

                    In this paper, we conduct a literature review on the types of common vulnerabilities and their
                    corresponding exploits against these devices and evaluate possible countermeasures, and then we
                    finally propose an enhanced solution by using a risk assessment that suits our problem best,
                    providing results where applicable.
                </p>

                <h3> 2.0 Related work or literature review</h3>
                <h4> 2.1 Background </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A video surveillance system in and of itself is a tool used to improve the
                    security of certain aspects of an institution, in particular to the physical security of assets,
                    persons and dependent systems. However, preventing network-related cyber attacks in video
                    surveillance systems is paramount because these systems inherently pertain to informational, cyber
                    and physical security hazards and pose a significant risk if proper control measures are not
                    implemented during a system’s development life cycle. </p>
                <h4> 2.2 Current Vulnerabilities </h4>
                <h5>2.2.1 Man in the middle</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>Previously, threat actors have been able to manipulate the video streams of
                    IP-cameras allowing them to inject edited footage or freeze a frame in addition to traditional
                    methods of attack such as a denial of service (DoS) attacks [3]. </p>
                <h5>2.2.2 Data exfiltration</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>Costin’s [3] survey has shown that the aforementioned systems could be used to
                    send and receive data through covert side-channels (for example, acoustic, thermal, optical, and
                    electromagnetic). This vulnerability can be exploited in air-gapped systems to leak sensitive
                    information such as passwords and documents and could be used to allow an advanced adversary to
                    maintain a foothold in the network as a means to repeat an attack.
                </p>
                <h5>2.2.3 Insecure software</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>Many different vendors of IP CCTV cameras employ the use of simple generic
                    firmware. The firmware lends itself to vulnerabilities (some made publicly known and listed as a
                    CVE) given its simple architecture and apparent lack of development using modern network security
                    practices. </p>
                <p class='articleText'>If adequate due diligence in the form of encrypting source code and digital
                    signing is not conducted throughout the deployment stage of the device firmware development, an
                    attacker can reverse engineer the firmware to search for vulnerabilities in the code itself. An
                    attacker could potentially upload a form of malware to the camera.[2] Of the two methods mentioned
                    above, the practice of code encryption does not necessarily lie within the best interest of the
                    manufacturer as obfuscating code decreases the likelihood of investigation by well-intended security
                    researchers[10]. </p>
                <p class='articleText'>Attackers using arbitrary code execution (ACE) vulnerabilities found within the
                    software can execute any command on the device running it. From this, it follows that the attacker
                    can perform privilege escalation and perform other malicious tasks. ACE vulnerabilities have been
                    found in IP cameras, DVRs, and routers. [4] According to cvedetails, ACE vulnerabilities are the
                    most prevalent CVEs found [12].</p>
                <h5>2.2.4 Supply chain</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>During the manufacturing process, there’s a risk that threat actors can insert a
                    rootkit or hardware-based spyware into the firmware. This is called a supply-chain attack and it is
                    very unlikely to occur but it could allow an advanced threat actor (such as an advanced persistent
                    threat) to have complete control over the device as well as the local network. [4]</p>
                <h5>2.2.5 Protocol-based</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>WEP, WPA2 and WPA3 are security certification programs developed by the WiFi
                    alliance. WPA2 is the most common certification currently in use, being used in 68.42% of polled
                    networks [6], and was developed in 2004. While WPA2 is a set-up from the original WEP, being 16
                    years old it still has significant vulnerabilities. For example, WPA2 can be exploited by a method
                    known as KRACK. [5] KRACK is where an intruder performs a replay attack exploiting the
                    vulnerabilities of resending message 3 in the four-way handshake used by WPA2. This allows the
                    attacker to manipulate the packets being sent. [6]</p>
                <h5>2.2.6 Botnet</h5>
                <p class='articleText'>With the bandwidth allowed to these sorts of devices, IP cameras can not only
                    pose a vulnerability to the network they are active on and the business that owns them but also to
                    the wider internet as well, an example of a situation like this that had come to pass would be the
                    Mirai malware attack in 2016, a malware that specifically targeted IoT devices due to there weak
                    security with a lot of them still relying on default passwords making them easy to infect [2]. This
                    example attack managed to disrupt a significant portion of the internet at the time by attacking the
                    DNS provider DYN with a DDOS attack using over 100,000 infected devices. This attack goes to
                    highlight the massive impact that the array of security flaws in these devices can have.</p>

                <h3> 3.0 Proposed Risk Assessment </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>In this section, we will present a risk assessment based on the previously
                    identified vulnerabilities and solutions. We will quantify each vulnerability on how likely it is to
                    be exploited and the potential risk to the network if it is exploited. We will be using a scale of 1
                    to 10, with 1 being low risk and 10 being the highest risk.</p>
                <p class='articleText'>Please see the risk assessment table in the appendix.</p>
                <h3>4.0 Evaluation of Solution</h3>
                <p class='articleText'>Our methodology for evaluating our proposed solutions is to reference experiments
                    from other sources and then evaluate them based on how well they solve the solution and how much we
                    can learn from them. The reason behind this approach is due to the nature of some of these
                    vulnerabilities we do not have the resources to set up a full experiment ourselves and collect data.
                    For example, a supply chain attack.</p>
                <h4>4.1 Man in the middle </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study by Michael R. Lyu and Lorrien K. Y. Lau focuses on evaluating the
                    effectiveness of Firewalls in networks. The study evaluates the performance and security of
                    different types of firewalls. The study focuses on the fact that it is necessary to achieve a
                    balance between security and performance when choosing a firewall. </p>
                <p class='articleText'><b>Figure 1</b> from the study assesses firewalls with security policies of 1 to
                    7 with higher being more secure. Their study shows the effectiveness of firewalls in preventing MitM
                    attacks and other vulnerabilities.</p>
                <img src='Images/Second Article/Figure1.png' />
                <img src='Images/Second Article/Figure2.png' />
                <p class='articleText'>It is also proven that generally, as the protection increases, performance
                    decreases. See <b>Figure 2</b> which shows the direct transaction time increase with each security
                    policy
                    level. [18]</p>

                <h4> 4.2 Insecure Software </h4>
                <img />
                <p class='articleText'>Furthermore, studies conducted by Frederick T. Sheldon et al showcased the impact
                    of insecure software being used in wireless networks. The study investigates ways in which network
                    security can be improved and how
                    attacks can be mitigated. It is shown in <b>Figure 3</b>, which assesses different firmware versions
                    against an attack, that firmware is crucial for network security. <b>Figure 3</b> shows that up to
                    date
                    firmware can be the difference between a successful attack or a failed one. The study concludes that
                    having the most up to date firmware possible is the best approach to mitigate vulnerabilities. [19]
                </p>
                <h4> 4.3 Supply Chain </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study by Chad W Autry and L. Michelle Bobbit proposes a framework for supply
                    chain security. In
                    their study, they collected data from 31 supply chains to assess the security vulnerabilities of
                    them and suggest improvements. In their proposed framework they suggest a series of technological
                    improvements to increase the security of the supply chain. For example, based on data collected from
                    supply managers, it suggests that electronically scanning shipments and using real-time technology
                    to mitigate tampering. [17] </p>
                <h4> 4.4 Protocol based </h4>
                <p class='articleText'>A study conducted by Cristian L. Leca in Romania conducted an assessment of over
                    100,000 networks
                    assessing their security protocols.
                    The study showed that over 4 years, the city of Bucharest had an increase in more modern security
                    certifications, up to 86% using WPA2 which is in line with the world standard. The results of the
                    study showed that attacks on wireless networks decreased over the 4 years as a direct result of the
                    adoption of more up to date protocols. [14]

                <h3> 5.0 Conclusion </h3>
                <p class='articleText'>In conclusion, with the world being ever more interconnected the importance of
                    good security measures
                    in video surveillance systems is as high as ever. With issues that can be present anywhere from
                    default software and hardware to issues based on outdated protocols, it is highly recommended that
                    users, as well as manufacturers, should enact the solutions outlined in our risk assessment to
                    mitigate the corresponding risks. Though due to limitations in hardware availability and our ability
                    to meet in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic we had to rely on previous data and results of
                    other researchers which have been proven effective in their techniques for shoring up defences of
                    the user in the fight against malicious attacks. However, with technology rapidly evolving new risks
                    will always develop and users must keep themselves informed of new threats and ways to mitigate them
                    to ensure network security in the future. Additionally, the vulnerabilities mentioned here is not a
                    complete list of all potential threats, just the ones viewed as most significant.
