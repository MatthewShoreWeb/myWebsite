                <h3> Who am I? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Hello, thank you for taking the time to visit my website. My name is Matthew
                    Shore. I am currently in my
                    third and final year of my Computer Science degree at the University of Portsmouth. The reason that
                    I decided to study Computer Science is because I have always enjoyed working with computers and using computers
                    to solve problems.
                </p>

                <h3> What are my goals? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    My goal is to pursue a career in Web Development once I graduate. I have mostly
                    been focused on front-end develoment so far
                    however, I do have back-end experience and it is something that I am looking to build upon both at
                    home and professionally.
                </p>

                <h3> What is my relevant experience? </h3>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Work experience: I worked for 13 months as a front-end web devloper at Fresh Relevance which is a
                    company based in Southampton.
                    This was done as my placement year for my degree. My main responsibilities involved writing scripts
                    using Javascript which could be put on
                    to client's websites to track the browsing habits of users.
                </p>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Independent Projects: In my spare time I undertake many independent projects.
                    This website is a great
                    example of the independent projects that I undertake. The purpose of all my projects is to develop
                    my
                    skills in that particular area. See the projects page on this site for more information on what I
                    do.
                </p>

                <p class='articleText'>
                    IBM Subversive Project: From September 2017 till July 2018 I took part in the IBM
                    Subversive Project.
                    This project was about cyber security vulnerabilities and how we can demonstate these
                    vulnerabilities to
                    people with limited technical knowledge of cyber security. For this project as a team of 3, we had
                    to
                    plan, design, create and present a model of an airport and demonstrate the cyber security risks
                    found at
                    an airport. We demonstated our project using Raspberry-pi and LED lighting to IBM cyber security
                    professionals in July. This project was great to undertake, the skills I gained from this project,
                    such
                    as designing/implementing a solution and team work are very valuable and are skills I continue to
                    develop today.

                <p class='articleText'>
                    Programming Experience: I have experience of C#/C++/Java/Python – A-Level and
                    University coursework’s
                    have been in these languages. I am reasonably competent at them. I work on developing my skills in
                    these
                    programming languages each week.
                </p>
